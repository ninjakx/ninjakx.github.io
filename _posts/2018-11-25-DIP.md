# IMAGE ENHANCEMENT:
It is the process of image manipulation to make it more suitable for specific use. 
It provides better contrast and a more detailed image and is used to enhance medical images, images captured in remote sensing, images from satellite etc.
Image Enhancement can be done in:
- ## Spatial Domain: There is a direct manipulation of pixel in an image (on the image plane)
- ## Frequency Domain: Processing the image is based on modifying the Fourier transformof an image.

## Why is it done?
It is done for the following reasons:
- Highlighting interesting detail in images.
- Removing noise from images.
- Making images more visually appealing.

The transformtion function is given as follows:

          S = T(r)
----------------------------------------------------------

where r is the pixels of the imput image
      s is the pixels of the output image.
      T is a transformation function that maps each value to r to each value of s.

It can be achieved through grey level transformations.

## BASIC GREY LEVEL TRANSFORMATIONS
### IMAGE NEGATIVES:
It reverses the grey level order.
Let the image has an intensity level in the range **[0 L-1]**, then the intensity
transformation is given by 
**s=L-1-r** 

### LOG TRANSFORMATIONS:
For an image having intensity ranging from **[0 L-1]**, log transformation is given
by 
**s=c log(1+r)** , where c is a constant.
It compresses the dynamic range of images with large variation in the pixel value.

**Properties**:
- For lower apmplitudes of input image the range of grey levels is expanded.
- For higher amplitudes of input image the range of grey levels is compressed.


### POWER-LAW TRANSFORMATIONS:
There are further two transformation is power law transformations, that include nth power and nth root transformation.
Expression for power law transformation is given as:
![img1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B100%7D%20s%20%3D%20c*r%5E%5Cgamma)
where 
Î³ and c are real numbers.

This transformation is also known as gamma transformation.
This type of transformation is used for enhancing images for different type of display devices. 
The gamma of different display devices is different. 
For example Gamma of CRT lies in between of 1.8 to 2.5, that means the image displayed on CRT is dark.

### PEICEWISE TRANSFORMATIONS
- **CONTRAST STRETCHING**
It is to increase the dynamic range of the grey levels in the image being processed.
It produce higher contrast than the original image by:
- Darkening the levels below m in the original image.
- Brightening the levels above m in the original image.


- **GREY LEVEL SLICING**
- **BIT-PLANE SLICING**
