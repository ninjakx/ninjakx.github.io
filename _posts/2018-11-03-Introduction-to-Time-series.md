# The Basics of Time Series Analysis:

## WHAT ARE TIME SERIES? 
Time series  is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. 
Or in other words, a collection of observations of well-defined data items obtained through repeated measurements over time at equal intervals e.g hourly, daily, weekly, quarterly, yearly, etc. It is mostly used to predict future occurrences based on previous observed occurrence or values.

**Examples:**
* Continuous monitoring of a person’s heart rate,
* Hourly readings of temperature or humidity,
* Daily closing stock prices,
* Monthly precipitation in a specific location,
* Yearly sales revenue/figures.
