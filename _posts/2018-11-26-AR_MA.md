# Auto Regressive(AR) Model

This model uses observations from some no of lagged observation i.e it takes observations from previous time steps as input to a regression equation to predict the value at the next time step.Or in other word, It predicts future behaviour based on past behaviour. 

> It’s used when there is some correlation between values in a time series and the values that precede and succeed them.It is an example of stochastic process, which have degrees of uncertainty or randomness in it. The randomness means that you might be able to predict future trends pretty well with past data, but you’re never going to get 100 percent accuracy.

The model is given as AR(p) where p is the order of autoregressive part and gives the info about how many lagged observation have to be taken. 
This model can be summarised as a linear regression model whose Equation is given as

y<sub>t</sub><= δ + φ<sub>1</sub>y<sub>t-1</sub> + φ<sub>2</sub>y<sub>t-2</sub> + … + φ<sub>p</sub>y<sub>t-1</sub> + A<sub>t</sub>

Where:
* y<sub>t-1</sub>, y<sub>t-1</sub>, y<sub>t-2</sub>….y<sub>t-p</sub>  are the lagged values.
* A<sub>t</sub> is white noise(randomness)
* δ is given as :
![delta equ](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/autoregressive-model.png) 
where μ  is the process mean.


AR(0): No dependence between the terms. Only the error/noise term contributes to the output of the process.
AR(1): Only the previous term in the process and the noise term contribute to the output.
AR(2): The previous two terms and the noise term contribute to the output.
