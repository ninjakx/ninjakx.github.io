Auto Regressive(AR) Model
This model uses observations from some no of lagged observation i.e it takes observations from previous time steps as input to a regression equation to predict the value at the next time step.
Or in other word, It predicts future behaviour based on past behaviour. [<sup>1</sup>](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/autoregressive-model/) It’s used when there is some correlation between values in a time series and the values that precede and succeed them.It is an example of stochastic process, which have degrees of uncertainty or randomness in it. The randomness means that you might be able to predict future trends pretty well with past data, but you’re never going to get 100 percent accuracy.
